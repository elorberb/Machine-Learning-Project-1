# Machine-Learning-Project-1
Using different Na√Øve Bayes models for classification.
During the first part of the project we worked on the MNIST dataset in order to identify the digit from pictures of handwritten numbers.
In this part we used the Scikit-learn library.
In the second part of the project, we implemented multinomial naive bayes algorithm to classify text documents.
We used the dataset "20 newsgroups" for this part.
We compare the results of the model with accuracy metric while using a pipeline that transform the words (we used CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer) and then run the model.
